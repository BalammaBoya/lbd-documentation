* Introduction
** General Information
Project Title: Learning by Doing (LbD) based course content development for 17 courses in areas of CS and ECE

 LbD project initiated by the Ministry of Human Resources and Development (MHRD). The objective of this project is to
content development for 17 courses in areas of CS and ECE. Currently there
 are around 11 courses  have been developed in the Learning by Doing and  Buftterfly Model. 
 The integration process of LbD courses described here defines
 the development. It aims at delivering 17 courses in areas of CS and ECE.

** Project Overview
It is natural for one to be more interested if one is involved in what
one does. This project aims to develop digital content in the CS and
ECE field using the Learning by Doing (LBD) methodology. The student
will in turn be able to learn, appreciate and apply the concepts
learnt in a class by applying them in real life.  In this approach
each course is divided into tasks (tasks cover select topics). All the
tasks are interrelated and the whole may sum up to a project which the
student submits as a final work product. The student approaches the
tasks by going through resources that are provided. These resources
can be digital lectures, PPTs or Just in Time (JIT) lectures/notes. At
times a step by step approach is provided for each task to aid the
student while doing the task. Also, some tasks are related in such a
way that without completing the previous task the next task cannot be
attempted. This will lay the emphasis on the student to do the tasks.
Doing the tasks will necessitate student involvement and thus the
student will be able to understand the concepts better by applying
them to a real world problem. Thus, this project is expected to have
considerable influence on the studentsâ€™ learning and retention rates,
thereby increasing the quality of the student community as such.  The
scope of the project is not limited to the core topics of the standard
CS and ECE curriculum but also to the advanced and synergetic courses
in the CS and ECE curriculum.


About LbD Methodology: The LbD methodology is built on the
constructionist approach and promotes a learner oriented learning
environment. It fosters skill development and the learning of factual
information through hands-on implementation of the associated
concepts. It thus sensitizes people to the use of the knowledge rather
than acquiring knowledge for its own sake. In this methodology,
mentors assist the students in their course work by "providing hints
and not solutions".Unlike the conventional (classroom) mode of
teaching, the student to teacher ratio in this model is low, which
allows for personalized mentoring and growth of the student.  In this
learning model, lesson/unit goals and expectations are set at the
beginning, so learners understand what they are trying to achieve and
the expected level of that achievement. Learners discuss multiple
strategies of solving the problems with the mentor, allowing the
learners to understand the various ways in which they can solve the
problems that they encounter. Feedback is given by the mentors during
learner interactions (through presentations and discussions) which
allows the learners to revise their projects/artifacts. Also, an
involvement with applications in the real world allows the learning
process to take place in a more meaningful context.


Learning by Doing methodology students can learn their own with real time
examples. Student will get hands on experience while taking the course.
By LbD project student can  attain practical knowledge project centered
curriculum. Learn to solve real world problems. Adapt to ever changing
technologies. eg. I hear, I forget : I see, I remember: I do, I understand

* Motivation

This document is driven by the commitment of delivering 17 courses which can be accomplished by following an efficient integration
process. This process ensures a thorough developing content of all 17 courses
 before they get upload on portal and made availabe to the end
 users. A well-organised Quality Assurance process, involving defect identification, defect reporting
 and defect fixing, defined in this document would ensure high quality
 labs. The entire workflow starting
from the development to the integration of a lab is detailed in the followings sections.

** About The Butterfly Model
The basis of the model Butterflies symbolize change. In ancient mythology, the
butterfly was a symbol of wisdom and everlasting knowledge. Our model's
blending of the different learning styles of the learners and their higher
order thinking skills makes us believe that this model will result in a
metamorphosis in the way students learn. Since the basis of the Butterfly model
is the learning by doing methodology the focus is on doing "tasks" and showing
work output. We have identified and designed various components that would help
the student in the learning process.

Mapping to the model We have designed 9 components in this model. Each of these
can be mapped to the butterfly anatomy. 

Learning objectives prepare the butterfly for its flight by making it think "why it is flying and where it is flying" similar to the student thinking "why he/she is learning the course".
Implementation: It is known that the thorax or the body of the butterfly helps in its flight. Similarly, the implementation component has the tasks that the student works on and forms the main structure around which the rest of the flight is built. 
Resources: These are available at the antennae of the butterfly and help in sensing the butterfly's direction, guiding it to its intended destination. Our model provides assistance that is tailored to the level of progress being made by the learner, thus guiding the learner toward the final destination. The key is that help is not thrown at the learner indiscriminately, but is provided on an as-needed basis. The hind- wings and the fore-wings help the butterfly in its flight and play a critical role. 

In our model, Concepts & Analysis components act as fore-wings and Playground & Imagination act as hindwings.
At the intersection of these wings are Illustration & Insights.

A novice learner may start with the learning objectives, proceed to the implementation component, and navigate in
the left section of the butterfly. An advanced learner may begin navigating in the right section of the butterfly and get
more insights into the subject. An intermediate learner navigates in both the left and right sections of the butterfly
and accesses components. 

Thus, once a student completes a module in this model he/she will be able to fly comfortably and also let their
imagination take flight. 

Each of the components of the model will now be described in greater detail. Though there is no strict order in which
these components should be accessed, we suggest the following order: learning objectives, implementation,
concepts, illustration, playground, resources, analysis, imagination and insights.

*** Learning objectives:
The "Learning Objectives" put together form the concepts the courses covers.
In general, learning objectives are introduced at the start of the course so that learners understand what they are trying
to achieve and the level of the achievement. This allows students to participate as active, independent learners as
they are clearly told what they should be able to do at the end of the course. Thus, learning objectives put the focus on
the learner and learning rather than the teacher and the teaching.

How will learning objectives help?
Taxonomies can be useful in getting ideas for the types of learning objectives to consider and in checking the
completeness of a set of objectives. One example is Bloom's taxonomy, in which general concepts and specific skills are 

introduced in the beginning. The ability of students to recall information and understand its meaning is
then verified. An explanation on how the concepts and skills are related to each other follows, which bridges the abstract
with the concrete. Finally, the ability of students in applying the knowledge to real-life scenarios, breaking down the
information into component parts, applying the knowledge in new domains, and judging the value of the information
are assessed.

Given the fact that the employability level of our graduates is very low, our primary focus in this effort has been on
improving their skills and thinking abilities. We ensured that the learning objectives chosen by us touched on the
higher order thinking skills mentioned in Bloom's taxonomy. Moreover, the learning objectives are mapped to the
assessments that we conduct during and at the end of the course. Such a mapping also makes both our assessment of
student performance and student self-assessment easier as students can assess their own progress and concentrate on
their weaker skills. This is especially important for professional students who are looking to gain specific skills
and knowledge. Once the learning objectives are set, the students move on to the implementation part.

*** Implementation: 
The "Implementation" Involves tasks when completed lead to prototypes of basics products in the area.
The implementation involves tasks which when completed lead to prototypes of basic products in the area. According
to Piaget, "a sufficient experimental training was believed to have been provided as long as the student had been
introduced to the results of past experiments or had been allowed to watch demonstration experiments conducted by
his teacher, as though it were possible to sit in rows on a wharf and learn to swim merely by watching grown-up
swimmers in the water. It is true that this form of instruction by lecture and demonstration has often been supplemented
by laboratory work by the students, but the repetition of past experiments is still a long way from being the best way of
exciting the spirit of invention, and even of training students in the necessity for checking for verification".

Research has confirmed many of the seemingly intuitive benefits of hands-on learning and has also documented a
variety of unanticipated benefits. An often quoted Chinese proverb "I hear and I forget; I see and I remember; I do and
I understand" succinctly puts our point across. Without hands-on learning students rely for the most part of their
learning on memory and abstract thought, two methods which restrict learning in most students. By actually doing
and experiencing, students develop their critical thinking skills as well as discover scientific concepts. This self
discovery stays with students throughout their lifetime while memory fades. Moreover, hands on exercises force students
to think by requiring interpretation of the observed events, rather than memorization of correct responses. Therefore,
the justification for hands-on learning is that it allows students to build understanding that is functional and to
develop the ability to inquire on their own, in other words, to become independent learners. In this section, the emphasis is 
on application. The next section i.e. concepts as the name suggests covers all the concepts in the module. This section 
actually gives the student enough knowledge about the module.

*** Concepts: 
The "Concepts" when concatenated form a lecture-based course.
These refer to the reading material that the students refer to for doing the tasks. These concepts are provided by the
domain expert in the form of video lectures (also called spoken tutorials). Thus, the individual concepts when 
concatenated form a lecture-based course. Students can refer to the resources section for further information on the
related concept.

*** Resources: 
The "resources" form a collection of various multi-model resources including the breakthrough papers in the area.
These include additional material that will be useful for the student. These include presentations, videos, external links,
and prescribed books for reference. Considering the different learning styles of the students we have designed
resources in various formats (text, audio, and video). These resources when concatenated form a collection of various
multi-modal resources including the breakthrough papers in the area. Research has shown that learning is more when information is presented via computer animation systems than through traditional classroom lectures. Using an interactive animation will solve the problem of the imagination-skill in education and training. Therefore, the ability to practice new concepts in a risk-free environment improves learners' skills and abilities. The next two sections pertain to "Illustrations" and "Playground" through animations and a virtual learning environment. The first of these, the "Illustration" section, comprises of explanation of the concepts via illustration of a concept generally through animation/simulation. The second, the "Playground" section, provides the user with a virtual lab to try out the "experiment". We will now discuss in detail about each section and also bring out the importance of using animations/simulations in the butterfly model.

*** Illustration:
The "Illustration" form an (animated e-workbook with solved examples.
The importance of illustrations is well understood in learning. Illustrations may be static, i.e., text book examples that elucidate the concept without learner interaction. However, an illustration that allows the learner to try out possibilities - interactive illustration through whatif examples, help learning happen better. Further, benefits of employing animations/simulations in education have been widely discussed. Agina has explained the benefits of using animation in education and training namely skill and ability improvement, interactivity, and engagement. The main advantage of employing animations in education is to show the "non-possible" in real-life learning possible. Learners have more interaction with the content and are thus more likely to assimilate the knowledge, skills and concepts involved. More importantly, this approach appeals to different learning styles, allowing personalization possibilities to learning.

In this section, the instructor explains a particular concept through animations, which may be static or interactive
illustrations.

*** Playground:
The "playground" forms a virtual workshop for the courses

Interactive learning with live-action animation, simulation,video, audio, graphics, feedback, expert advice, and questions and answers keeps learners interested and reinforces skills. Because it is exciting, challenging, and fun to use, it encourages learners to return to the program again and again! Through continual practice, learning is absorbed and integrated into daily performance. Moreover animations allow for flexible education and training and ultimately inspire learners to learn more. Through interactive and what-if simulations, students take less time to learn complex things. This can be attributed to the fact that there is more student involvement in this process.

It is important to mention that computer animation also improves the skills and ability of instructors because they
will be able to improve and enhance their way of teaching. During the process of the animation, instructors can open
free-discussion among learners, which will positively affect the entire classroom. It is important to note that the learners'
feedback could be useful to improve the animation/simulation system itself! Animation of the student can be working by himself/herself. So the student is empowered to try out new things and learn by himself/herself.

Simply put, the collection of different "playground" sections forms a virtual workshop for the course.
The next three components are designed keeping in mind  the advanced (read research-oriented student). Primarily our
focus over here is to make the student think further and explore beyond the said 

*** Analysis:  
The "Analysis" forms detailed versions of the "truths" in the courses (like mathematical proofs).
To be concise, this section forms detailed versions of the truths in the course (like mathematical proofs). The student
is explained how the concept is reached at through the proofs.

*** Insights: 
The "Insights" trace the literature's evolution leading to the entire course.
Insights can be classified as historical insights which trace to the literature's evolution leading to the entire course. In
addition, questions posed here could help in learners getting altogether new insights.

*** Imagination: 
"Imagination" is about the research idea "explosion" aftermath of the
conception courses.  The imagination is about the research/idea "explosion"
aftermath of the course/concept. This section leaves the student thinking on
what's next and can be considered a precursor to the next module. The content
thus developed in this model, will cater to a wide range of students ranging
from the novice to the advanced.
